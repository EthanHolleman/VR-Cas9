GUIDES_PER_CONSTRUCT: 5  # number of gRNA oligos to select per construct.
MAX_DIST_FROM_START: 1000  # Distance from the start of the construct sequence
                           # to the furthest gRNA start. This defines the window
                           # that gRNAs will be selected from. The workflow
                           # will attempt to evenly distribute rRNAs within
                           # this window.
